# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects, each focusing on a specific algorithm or technique. The goal is to explore, implement, and analyze different machine learning methods using Python.

## Project Structure
Each folder represents a distinct topic or algorithm in machine learning, with relevant code and examples.

### 1. **Area Under the ROC Curve**
   - Implements the computation and visualization of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
   - Includes methods to calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for model evaluation.
   - Focuses on binary classification performance metrics.

### 2. **Decision Tree Regression**
   - Implements decision trees for regression tasks.
   - Includes visualization of decision boundaries and tree structures.
   - Demonstrates parameter tuning for depth and splitting criteria.

### 3. **Discrimination by Regression**
   - Explores regression models used for discrimination tasks.
   - Demonstrates logistic regression and other discriminative models.
   - Analyzes data separability and feature importance.

### 4. **Expectation-Maximization Clustering**
   - Implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering.
   - Focuses on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and probabilistic clustering methods.
   - Includes visualization of cluster distributions.

### 5. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
   - Implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
   - Covers both Gaussian and Multinomial variants.
   - Demonstrates its use in text classification and other domains.

### 6. **Nonparametric Regression**
   - Explores nonparametric regression techniques like kernel regression and splines.
   - Highlights their flexibility in capturing nonlinear patterns.
   - Includes comparisons with parametric methods.
